### Local Variables
```cs
// Local variables are similar to normal C# : type id (optional assign)
i32 myLocalVariable = 123;

// It is also possible to initialize multiple variables similar to C# but with a different syntax
i32 variableA, variableB = 50;  // Both variables initialized with value '50'

// And you can also initialize each with a unique value
string varaibleA, variableB = { "Hello", "World" }
```
