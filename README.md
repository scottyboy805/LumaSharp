# LumaSharp
C# programming language reimagined

C# is a powerful and mature language with frequent new features added all the time, and as a result has a certain amount of ambiguity as those features have been built upon over the years. Quite simply there are many ways to achieve the same thing in the language which can make it feel disjointed in some cases in my opinion. LumaSharp is my personal idea of what I think the perfect C# inspired language may look like if it was redesigned from stratch today, taking into consideration all the current features that a language like C# has to offer.
